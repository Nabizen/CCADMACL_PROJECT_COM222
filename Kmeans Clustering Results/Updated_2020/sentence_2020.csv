Gcash's customer service escalations is the worst. I had reported an erroneous cash-in with ONE number difference the same hour it was made thru Touch Pay.

"EVERYONE BEWARE: Once you create a GCash account, you will not be able to delete it. Even when you contact their customer support requesting them to delete your account, they will reply with, ""As stated in the GCash Terms and Conditions, we are unable to delete your account."" That is the response I received from them. A company is not the boss of our personal information and should not ever overpower the consumer decision to delete our account. It should not matter what the 'terms and conditions' state. It should be illegal for a company like Gcash to behave this way. Mynt - Globe Fintech Innovations and GCash, you are rotten.",1.0

Transactions should have an ending balance. It is so confusing where the money come and goes. Also whenever I try to verify my account it doesn't send any code to my email.

This is a very unsecure system. Especially when you turn the contacts syncing on. You will definitely have a great chance to hack other accts in your directory just by guessing the MPIN. You guys should prioritize the upgrade of your security like MFA or even use a damn password as what coins.ph app is doing! I must admit you have more services than coins.ph app but if you have a very unsecure system you better shut off your business.,4.0

A great app for personal use and you can have a eloading business. One of the functionality that need to be add up i think that it can be access offline. Like if you don't have a personal internet load it cannot be access so if you have still a balance and you want to pay in the store that accept gcash payment and you don't have load. It is worthless.

maganda sana gcash. pero mas ok sana kung ung reflection ng mga transactions lumalabas agad. lalo na pag sa load ang transaction na gagawin. kasi once na magkamali ng type ng number ang customer. makikita agad at masusulusyonan agad. e kung 24 hours bago lumabas ung transaction. mahirap. sana mapansin nyo ang suggestion ko. at magawan ng solusyon. salamat,4.0

Gcash may be a helpful app especially during the covid situation which we are given a choice to pay with bank transfers and online payment but the fees which are taken are getting bigger and bigger. I was surprised to have a 200php service fee for cashing in 10k in 711 since 200php is already a big amount of money but since i dont have the access to pay in any other way im forced to bear the 200php service fee i am really disappointed especially this time of crisis wishing they would notice this,4.0

"GCash forces one to become ""Fully Verified"" to be able to use some of the features, but there's always a SYSTEM ERROR when you do try to get Fully Verified. GCash then asks for sensitive information like those required at bank (signature specimen, etc.) to be sent through chat and e-mail for ""manual verification."" Um, NO. Even banks advise against giving out information through those channels. GCash. ..Why can't you just fix the ""system error?"" Why are you even asking for signature samples?",1.0

For the longest time gcash has been reliable when it comes to money transfer / bills payments and convenience paying off with cashless transactions. Even without the pandemic it always has been free to do this transactions. How come when this is just becoming the new normal for a more safe way to pay even without human contact that suddenly customers will be charged for convenience fees. I'm just hoping that you could still be the best out of all the options out there & remove convenience fees,4.0

The perks of not yet being verified is kinda frustrating. How on earth can I use gcash if everything is manipulated thru the use of an ID? And the options are limited. Should've atleast added NBI or PSA birth cert. For people just starting out this app is not pretty helpful. It's a trap putting in money and not able to get it in times of need and no IDs present. Who the heck would use your money app other than you? Too many unnecessary patches.,3.0
